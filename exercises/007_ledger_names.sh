# In the previous exercise, we created some accounts on different ledgers.
# But what do ledgers represent?

# Ledgers partition accounts into groups.
# These groups can represent anything you want. Often, they are used
# to represent different currencies, assets, or they can be used for
# multi-tenant setups where each ledger represents a different customer.

# In our application logic, we might store a mapping between each currency
# and the numeric ledger identifier we'll use in TigerBeetle:
USD_LEDGER=70
EUR_LEDGER=71
YEN_LEDGER=72
