# Uh oh! Our data file needs a filename!

# TigerBeetle is designed to run in production as a cluster of 6 replicas.
# The --replica and --replica-count arguments specify how many replicas
# are in the cluster and which one this is (that info is stored in the
# data file).

# For now, though, we'll just use a single-replica cluster for simplicity.
