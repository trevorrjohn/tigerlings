# Now, let's return to our bank example and add some balance limits.

# It may be tempting to use `lookup_accounts` or `get_account_balances`
# to check the account balance in the application logic before creating a transfer.
# However, this is unsafe!
# The account balance could change between the time you check it and the time you create the transfer.

# Instead, we can use the built-in features to enforce balance limits atomically in the database.
