# In the previous exercise, we used the `user_data_128` field to "connect"
# multiple accounts and multiple transfers.

# However, that doesn't actually ensure that those groups of accounts or
# group of transfers are created atomically. It is possible for one to fail
# while the other succeeds.

# If we want to atomically create multiple accounts or multiple transfers together,
# we need to `link` them.

# Let's say we once again want to create 4 accounts across 2 ledgers:
# The `linked` flag links one event _to the next event in the request_.
# The last event in a linked group _does not have the flag set_.
tb "create_accounts id=2100 code=10 ledger=200 flags=linked,
                    id=2101 code=11 ledger=201,
                    id=2102 code=12 ledger=200 flags=linked,
                    id=2103 code=13 ledger=201;"

# Now, accounts 2100 and 2101 are linked, so that either both will be created or neither will be created.
# Accounts 2102 and 2103 are also linked in this way.

# Note that multiple groups of linked events can exist together in a single request.

# Now, let's create some transfers!

# Can you modify this request so:
# - The first 2 transfers succeed together
# - The 3rd transfer fails on its own
# - The 4th and 5th transfers fail together
# - The 6th transfer succeeds on its own
