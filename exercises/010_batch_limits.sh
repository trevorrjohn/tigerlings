# Our last exercise created multiple accounts in one request and multiple transfers in another.

# In the previous exercise we created multiple transfers, but each in a separate request.
# We said that everything in TigerBeetle is batched for efficiency and performance
# -- so let's take advantage of that!

# Let's go crazy here and create 8190 accounts in a single request!
# Why 8190? That's the maximum number we can send in a request.

# (If you're running TigerBeetle using a debug build, you'll see that this error
# is triggered by an assertion failure in the client. TigerBeetle makes heavy use
# of assertions to ensure that it operates as expected.)
